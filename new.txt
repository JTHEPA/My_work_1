Welcome, This is Word Count Program

An API (application programming interface) is a server that lets you request and send data using code. 

It works as a bridge between your app and external systems.

You get valuable data without having to gather it manually.

Think of an API as a waiter at a restaurant. You tell the waiter what you want.

They take your order to the kitchen. The kitchen prepares your food. 

The waiter brings it back to you.

When you work with a Python API, you send a request to an API server. 

It processes your request. Then it sends back the results.
